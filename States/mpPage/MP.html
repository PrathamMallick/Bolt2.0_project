                Bagh print is a traditional Indian handicraft that involves hand printing wood blocks using 
                natural colors and dyes. The craft originated in Bagh, a village in the Dhar district of 
                Madhya Pradesh, and is named after the village. <br><br>
                The print is characterized by a variety of geometric and floral designs made using vegetable dyes and 
                finely cut wooden blocks.
